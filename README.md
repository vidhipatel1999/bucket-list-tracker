# <Bucket List Tracker>
This tracker offers a personalized experience for logged-in users, enabling them to create and manage their own bucket list. Users can conveniently enter the name of the experience, the date it was added, their target completion date, and the location. The entire bucket list can be viewed on a dedicated page, where users also have the ability to view details of individual items, delete them, or update them as needed. Additionally, each item on the bucket list includes a section for notes, enhancing the ability to personalize and track progress.
